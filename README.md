# Number-Guesser
Number guessing game (Python)

Created a number guessing game using python that user try's to pick the correct number from between 1 and 100. I imported random and time, random for the computer to pick a random number for the user to guess, and time so I could give the game more of a thinking effect, like the computer was actually checking the number and talking to the user
